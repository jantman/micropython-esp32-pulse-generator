# micropython-esp32-pulse-generator

MicroPython project to use an ESP32 as a pulse generator

This is intended to be used as a test input for https://github.com/jantman/ludlum-3-esp32-scaler - it uses GPIO 4 with a pull-down resistor, and pulses are generated by pulling the pin low. The grounds of both ESP32s should be tied together, as should pin 4.

My plan is for this to eventually be a standalone unit with a display and buttons for input. Until then, it just has a command-line interface accessed through the MicroPython REPL.

This is currently tested to produce pulses from once every 3 seconds to 10kHz (10,000 pulses per second). The accuracy seems to be within 0.3%.
